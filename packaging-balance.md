## S3 USER GUIDELINE â€“ Packaging Balance

The purpose of this document is to provide guideline on how to use the Packaging Balance module of the Steering Support System \(S3\). 

The Packaging Balance module is designed to measure packaging of the produced goods, and to identify and quantify the losses. It is also an effective tool to control the improvement processes by identifying the opportunities for improvement and using the results to decide which project to start and/or to receive a feedback on existing ones.
