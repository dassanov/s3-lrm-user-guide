# **S3 USER GUIDELINE - OEE** {#s3-user-guideline-oee}

The purpose of this document is to provide guideline on how to use the OEE module of the Steering Support System (S3).

The OEE module is designed to measure line/machine effectiveness, and to identify and quantify the machine losses. It is also an effective tool to control the improvement processes by identifying the opportunities for improvement and using the results to decide which project to start and/or to receive a feedback on existing ones.
