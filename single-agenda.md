## **S3 USER GUIDELINE - SINGLE AGENDA**

The purpose of this document is to provide guideline on how to use the Single Agenda module of the Steering Support System \(S3\).

Single Agenda module is designed to measure the effectiveness of both LRM and non-LRM projects. It is also needed to estimate savings for the planned projects and reduce losses of the existing projects, which helps in deciding on which projects to start and/ or to improve ongoing ones.
